## üé¨ Demo Script (3 minutes)

**Minute 1: Problem & Solution**
> "Florida faces increasing hurricane risk. But which communities are MOST vulnerable? We built Lanzat to answer this by combining hurricane risk data, economic data, and social vulnerability metrics into a single score."

**Minute 2: Demo**
> [Show map] "Here's Florida. Counties in red are most vulnerable. [Click Miami-Dade] This popup shows the vulnerability score, GDP, and risk factors. [Show dashboard] Our dashboard highlights the top 10 most vulnerable counties and shows GDP vs vulnerability correlation."

**Minute 3: Impact & Tech**
> "Emergency managers can use this to prioritize resources. [Show filter] We can filter by risk level. [Show export] And export data for planning. We integrated 5 datasets‚ÄîNOAA hurricanes, BEA economics, CDC social vulnerability, FEMA risk, and Census boundaries‚Äîusing Python, FastAPI, and React."

**Closing:**
> "Lanzat helps save lives by identifying which communities need help most. Thank you!"

## üîß Emergency Fixes

**If things go wrong:**

### API Down
- [ ] Use static GeoJSON file in frontend
- [ ] Pre-load all data client-side
- [ ] Skip real-time features

### Deployment Fails
- [ ] Run locally, record demo video
- [ ] Use ngrok to expose local server
- [ ] Share Loom video instead of live demo

### Data Issues
- [ ] Use sample/mock data
- [ ] Reduce to top 20 counties only
- [ ] Simplify vulnerability formula

### Map Not Rendering
- [ ] Fall back to static image
- [ ] Use table view instead
- [ ] Show charts only
